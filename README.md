# Basic Transfer Learning Application in Vehicle Classification

 Vehicle classification has different use in our daily lives. Humans most likely can recognize difference in type of cars but that was not an easy task for a computer using image classification. In this study, using 1600 images with 4 different classes, we utilized deep network for the computer to easily recognize types of cars given an input image. Deep network are difficult to train and needs powerful laptop/computer that will process the complex computations of each layer of the network. To overcome this problem, we implemented the concept of transfer learning in vehicle classification. We used different state of the art models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNet and Xception.
